                Front end development is the part of web development that deals with the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It involves creating the layout, design, interactivity, and functionality of the web pages that users see and interact with. Front end developers use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and frameworks or libraries such as Bootstrap, React, or Angular, to create responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly web interfaces.

            <p class="subTag text-small">
                Back end development is the part of web development that deals with the server-side logic and data management of a website or web application. It involves creating, storing, retrieving, and manipulating the data that powers the web pages and the functionality of the web application. Back end developers use languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java, and databases or tools such as MySQL, MongoDB, or Firebase, to create secure, scalable, and efficient web applications.

            <p class="tag text-big">A Guide to Front-End vs. Back-End vs. Full-Stack Development</p>
            <p class="subTag text-small">
                Web development is a profession concerned with establishing the aesthetic, navigation and functionality of websites. Within this field are the subdisciplines of front-end, back-end and full-stack development, each of which fulfills a specific role and requires its own set of skills. If you're interested in pursuing a career in web development, it's important to understand what each subdiscipline entails and what proficiencies you may want to develop to optimize your chances of success. In this article, we define front-end, back-end and full-stack development, discuss the primary duties and competencies associated with these roles, outline the primary differences between them and provide information concerning the average salary and job outlook for each one.
            </p>
            <p class="subTag text-small">
                The work of back-end developers applies to the server side of operations. Their efforts aren't directly visible to users, but they're essential to the very existence of a website. Compare that with front-end developers, who apply their talents to the client side. They focus on creating an interface that enhances the experience for users. As for full-stack developers, they apply their broader range of competencies to all sides of web development.
            </p>
            <p class="subTag text-small">
                Back- and front-end developers tend to address different sets of challenges. Issues such as search engine optimization and user accessibility are the domain of front-end developers, while problems related to website security and backup are the responsibility of back-end developers. Full-stack developers address all of these problems, along with others, as they implement an integrated approach to web development.
